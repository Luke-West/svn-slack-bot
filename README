post-commit: Python hook used for SVN post commits

This script is set to publish information to Slack when SVN commits occur. 

Required files/Application/services:
    * Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
    * Working repository (you're on your own here)
    * Slack Domain and room

The user MUST edit the script file to add in
    * Slack API
    * Slack room name
    * a user name for display in Slack
    * location of svnlook command.
    * Edit revision_number.txt to latest revision if SVN repository isn't new to avoid a message being posted for every
      commit ever made.

I advice that you set this up with cron. When the program is run it will do 10 checks for new commits and then end. Set this up with cron to 
startup and run every 60 minutes or so and it will do all the work automatically.
